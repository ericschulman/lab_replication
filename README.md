# Overview

This repo replicates the results from four papers. It also provides stylized empirical examples of testing. These examples appear in [my job market paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14FdLzfvJzOyyH0F6itTg2TeE7dgiF9Jd/view).

1. Present bias in collective decisions? This is drawn from [this](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.12.4184) paper.
2. Selection bias or random? This is drawn from [this](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.96.3.847) paper.
3. Dynamic or static? This is drawn from [this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259?seq=1) paper.
There is a bonus example that did not appear in the paper:
4. Selection of covariates. This is drawn from [this](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.5.2226) paper.

Additionally

The code is organized as follows. The folders `colombia`, `lab_pref`, `lotto`, `dynamics`. The file called `test_results.ipynb` is the file file where the model selection test takes place. `selection_tests.py` is where the different versions of the model selection test are written. This module is imported in each of the seperate ipython notebooks. `shi_test.py` has a python implementation of [Shi (2015)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3982/QE382) as a reference point.

`selection_tests.py` and `shi_test.py` are designed to be compatible with likelihood models from statsmodels. The `dynamics` example useses a modified version of these files designed to be compabitible with the non-standard implementation of the model. 

# Lab data present biases

`test_results` for lab data requires running `replication_2.ipynb`. 

I revisit [Jackson and Yariv (2014)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.12.4184). study of present bias among collective decision makers using a lab experiment. This study find that 45 of their 60 lab participants have a present bias. The authors argue this would be unlikely if participants made random choices in their experiment.  I use the Vuong test to determine the statistical significance for whether the result is random chance or present bias. My proposed test rejects the null at the 99 percent level, supporting the authors' conclusions.


# Voucher program selection bias

In this example, I study whether there is a selection bias in the context of [Angrist et. al (2006)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.96.3.847). The code for this example is in `colombia`. This paper reports conflicting effects of vouchers on college entrance exam scores due to selection bias. They argue vouchers cause people to take the entrance exam, who would not ordinarily and lower the quality of the testing pool.  I assess which version of treatment effects are more credible using data. Based on the test results, the model with selection bias seems to over-estimate the effect of vouchers on exam scores. All three versions of the test select the model without a selection bias at the 99 percent confidence level. This example seems to illustrate the importance of running the model selection test. 

# Rust dynamic models

In this example, I compare a dynamic model of demand for bus engines to a static model in [Rust (1987)'s](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259?seq=1) bus engine replacement problem using the Vuong test. The code for this example is in `dynamics`. Rust (1987) tries to predict how the city's demand will respond to a change in replacement costs for the engines (i.e., if the cost changed, would the manager change his replacement frequency and by how much?). Rust estimates demand with a dynamic model and supports this model with a likelihood ratio test. I revisit his results with my new bootstrap test, which are more appropriate for this setting.

I have a more in depth explanation for the implementation of the rust model in the [following repository](https://github.com/ericschulman/struct/blob/master/hw4_io/Rust.ipynb).


# Lottery in the Netherlands


[Kuhn et. al (2011)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.5.2226) look at how neighbors income effects your expenditure. The code for this example is in `lotto`. They use data from the dutch postcode lottery to study whether having a neighbor wins effects various measures of income and expenditure. The economic theory of "Veblen effects" suggests that shocks to neighbors' incomes could also affect oneâ€™s own consumption, particularly in conspicuous consumption like buying a car or exterior renovations. Based on the analysis in the paper, the effect of neighbors winning on exterior home renovations is ambiguous. The sign depends on the definition of whether the neighbor won the lottery. Different versions of this variable seem to predict very different effects.  As we can see from Table 6 of the paper (reproduced below), under one definition the effect is slightly positive. Under the other, the effect is slightly negative.
